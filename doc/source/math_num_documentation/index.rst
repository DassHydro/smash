`smash` is a computational software framework dedicated to **S**\patially distributed **M**\odelling and **AS**\similation for **H**\ydrology, 
enabling to tackle spatially distributed differentiable hydrological modeling, with learnable parameterization-regionalization. 
This platform enables to combine vertical and lateral flow operators, either physically based or hydrid  with neural networks, and perform high 
dimensional non linear optimization from multi-source data. 
It is designed to simulate discharge hydrographs and hydrological states at any spatial location within a basin and reproduce the hydrological 
response of contrasted catchments, both for operational forecasting of floods and low flows, by taking advantage of spatially distributed 
meteorological forcings, physiographic data and hydrometric observations.

`smash` is a modular platform, open source and is designed for collaborative research and  operational applications.
It is based on a computationally efficient Fortran kernel enabling parallel computations over large domains, and that is automatically differentiable with the Tapenade engine :cite:p:`hascoet2013tapenade`  to generate the numerical adjoint model. The adjoint model enables to compute acurately the gradient of a cost function to high dimensional (spatially distributed) parameters and to perform optimization and learning.
It is interfaced in Python using f90wrap :cite:p:`Kermode2020-f90wrap` to (``i``) provide a user-friendly and versatile interface for quick learning 
and efficient development of research and applications, as well as to (``ii``) directly make accessible the wealth of Python modules and libraries developped by a large and active community (Data pre/post-Processing, Geographic Information System, Deep Learning, etc).

This documentation details the mathematical basis of the forward and inverse modeling problems, their numerical resolution along with optimization 
and estimation algorithms.
