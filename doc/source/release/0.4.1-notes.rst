Generating documentation
************************

The command ``make doc`` has been updated to prevent rebuilding the entire documentation in case of errors. 
The updated command will return to the previous version of the documentation if an error occurs, without requiring developers to rebuild the entire documentation from scratch.

For example, if a bug occurs when running the ``make doc`` command, it will result in the following message:

.. code-block:: bash

    An error occurred while generating the documentation. Returning to previous version.

This ensures that developers do not need to rebuild the entire documentation during subsequent generation processes.
