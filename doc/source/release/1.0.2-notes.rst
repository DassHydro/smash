smash 1.0.2 Release Notes
=========================

The smash 1.0.2 release continues the ongoing work to improve the handling, fix possible bugs, clarify the documentation.
The highlights are:

- ``Physiographic descriptor missing values``
    The handling of missing data in physiographic descriptors has been modified. `smash` no longer accepts
    missing data on active cells and returns an error on reading.

- ``Feasible domain on active cells``
    `smash` no longer returns an error if the values of parameters or initial states on non-active cells are
    outside the feasibility domain.

- ``Net scaling layer``
    Net scaling layer is now able to take the outputs from other activation functions (not only sigmoid) such
    as softmax and tanh.
