smash 1.0.1 Release Notes
=========================

The smash 1.0.1 release continues the ongoing work to improve the handling, fix possible bugs, clarify the documentation.
The highlights are:

- ``NumPy 2.0 support``
    `smash` now supports NumPy ``2.0`` and is backwards compatible to NumPy ``1.24``

- ``Math / Num documentation``
    Adjustments have been made in the forward & inverse problems section, as well as in the forward structure
    section, where flowcharts of the forward model and hydrological modules have been added.

- ``Fortran character limit``
    The character limit for directory paths and gauge codes has been increased from 128 to 256 and 20 to 128,
    respectively.
