smash 1.1.0 Release Notes
=========================

The smash 1.1.0 release introduces several new solvers and functionalities, while continuing efforts to improve usability, fix bugs, and enrich the documentation. The highlights are:

- ``Hybrid Physics-AI hydrological solvers: spatially distributed neural-augmented algebraic and ODE models``
    In addition to regionalization neural networks, the process-parameterization neural networks are integrated into `smash` for GR-like model structures to refine internal water fluxes, either within algebraic models solving analytical solutions of time-integrated ordinary differential equations (ODEs), or within state-space models that numerically solve the ODEs.

- ``Migration of optimization methods to Python``
    All optimization methods have been reimplemented in Python, replacing the previous Fortran-based versions. This change enables the use of various adaptive optimizers for all mappings and supports callback signatures for retrieving intermediate results during the calibration process.

- ``Convolutional neural networks for regionalization``
    Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are now supported for the HDA-PR (Hybrid Data Assimilation-Parameters Regionalization) algorithm. 
    The `smash.factory.Net` sub-package has been updated to accommodate a generic neural network configuration for regionalization.

- ``Variants of GR-like model structures``
    New variants of the GR-like model structures have been introduced, featuring alternative parameterizations of the conceptual reservoirs. 
    These updates also include the incorporation of rainfall intensity and imperviousness.

- ``Fix for active and non-active cells``
    Issues related to missing physical descriptors on active cells and incorrect handling of boundary conditions outside the calibration domain have been resolved.

- ``Expanded user guide``
    The user guide has been significantly expanded, now offering step-by-step tutorials ranging from quick-start examples to advanced usage of `smash`.

- ``Expanded contributor guide``
    The :ref:`Contributor Guide <contributor_guide>` has been significantly expanded, now providing more detailed explanations of the `smash` development process.

- ``Complete mathematical documentation``
    A more complete mathematical description of all methods used in `smash` is now available in the :ref:`Math / Num Documentation <math_num_documentation>`.
