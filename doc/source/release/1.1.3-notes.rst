smash 1.1.3 Release Notes
=========================

The smash 1.1.3 release fixes a few compatibility issues and enhances several functionalities, including:

- ``Separated computation of interception reservoir capacity``  
  The computation of the interception parameter can now be performed independently from model initialization.

- ``Improvements to meshing methods``  
  Several enhancements have been made to the meshing procedures, including updates to regional meshing, surface error computation, and bounding box calculations.

- ``OpenMP support for hybrid methods``  
  Hybrid model structures for flux correction (with algebraic resolution) can now be used with OpenMP to significantly reduce optimization time.
