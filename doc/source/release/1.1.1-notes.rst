smash 1.1.1 Release Notes
=========================

The smash 1.1.1 release continues the ongoing work to improve the handling, fix possible bugs, and enhance the documentation.
The highlights are:

- ``Temporary removal of Windows support``
    Windows support has been temporarily removed in this version due to a wheel build issue (https://github.com/DassHydro/smash/issues/433).

- ``Gradient-free optimizers``
    Two new gradient-free optimizers, Nelder-Mead and Powell algorithms, have been added alongside SBS.

- ``Enhanced user guide``
    New tutorials have been added, including guides on spatially distributed calibration and calibration with regularization terms.
