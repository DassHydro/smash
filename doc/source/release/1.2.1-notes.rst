smash 1.2.1 Release Notes
=========================

The smash 1.2.1 release adds functionalities and fixes some compatibility issues, including:

- ``New options for segmentation function``
    Two new arguments have been added for hydrograph segmentation: one to select the gauges (**gauge**)
    on which the segmentation is performed, and another to define an absolute threshold
    for event selection (**peak_value**).

- ``'gr4_ode_mlp' structure is deprecated and replaced by 'gr4_ude'``
    The name ``gr4_ode_mlp`` for the hybrid GR4 structure with flux correction in the state-space model
    is deprecated and replaced by ``gr4_ude`` for consistency with the associated research paper.

- ``New make command``
    A new ``make test-light`` command has been added to run a lightweight test suite on a
    single model structure, allowing for a quick check of core functionalities.
