Installation
------------

`smash` can be installed with pip on **Linux**, **Windows** or from source and supports Python versions **3.9** to **3.11**.

.. note::

    We strongly recommend using `smash` on **Linux**, particularly if you are using it on a large dataset, as 
    Fortran parallel computation is not supported on **Windows**. 

If you already have Python, you can install `smash` with:

.. code-block:: none

    pip install hydro-smash

------
Import
------

To access `smash` and its functions import it in your Python code like this:

.. code-block:: python

    import smash

Because of a name conflict on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/>`__, the distribution name (i.e. the name used in pip
install, ``hydro-smash``) is not the same as the package name (i.e. the name used to import, ``smash``).
