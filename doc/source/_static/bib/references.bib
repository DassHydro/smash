Both approaches are compared using a lumped hydrologic model (whose structure includes a soil moisture accounting (SMA) store and a routing store) on a data set of 178 French catchments. The main focus of this study was to investigate the actual impact of soil moisture initial conditions on the performance of flood forecasting models and the possible compensations with updating techniques. The rainfall-runoff model assimilation technique we used does not impact the SMA component of the model but only its routing part. Tests were made by running the SMA store continuously or on event basis, everything else being equal. The results show that the continuous approach remains the reference to ensure good forecasting performances. We show, however, that the possibility to assimilate the last observed flow considerably reduces the differences in performance. Last, we present a robust alternative to initialize the SMA store where continuous approaches are impossible because of data availability problems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Tapenade is an Automatic Differentiation (AD) tool which, given a Fortran or C code that computes a function, creates a new code that computes its tangent or adjoint derivatives. Tapenade puts particular emphasis on adjoint differentiation, which computes gradients at a remarkably low cost. This article describes the principles of Tapenade, a subset of the general principles of AD. We motivate and illustrate with examples the AD model of Tapenade, that is, the structure of differentiated codes and the strategies used to make them more efficient. Along with this informal description, we formally specify this model by means of data-flow equations and rules of Operational Semantics, making this the reference specification of the tangent and adjoint modes of Tapenade. One benefit we expect from this formal specification is the capacity to formally study the AD model itself, especially for the adjoint mode and its sophisticated strategies. This article also describes the architectural choices of the implementation of Tapenade. We describe the current performance of Tapenade on a set of codes that include industrial-size applications. We present the extensions of the tool that are planned in a foreseeable future, deriving from our ongoing research on AD.},

  abstract = {A generalization of the single soil layer variable infiltration capacity (VIC) land surface hydrological model previously implemented in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory general circulation model (GCM) is described. The new model is comprised of a two-layer characterization of the soil column, and uses an aerodynamic representation of the latent and sensible heat fluxes at the land surface. The infiltration algorithm for the upper layer is essentially the same as for the single layer VIC model, while the lower layer drainage formulation is of the form previously implemented in the Max-Planck-Institut GCM. The model partitions the area of interest (e.g., grid cell) into multiple land surface cover types; for each land cover type the fraction of roots in the upper and lower zone is specified. Evapotranspiration consists of three components: canopy evaporation, evaporation from bare soils, and transpiration, which is represented using a canopy and architectural resistance formulation. Once the latent heat flux has been computed, the surface energy balance is iterated to solve for the land surface temperature at each time step. The model was tested using long-term hydrologic and climatological data for Kings Creek, Kansas to estimate and validate the hydrological parameters, and surface flux data from three First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project Field Experiment intensive field campaigns in the summer-fall of 1987 to validate the surface energy fluxes.},

  abstract = {This paper describes in detail a semi-distributed conceptual rainfall-runoff model known as the ARNO model, which is now in widespread use both in land-surface-atmosphere process research and as an operational flood forecasting tool on several catchments in different parts of the world. The model, which derives its name from its first application to the Arno River, incorporates the concepts of a spatial probability distribution of soil moisture capacity and of dynamically varying saturated contributing areas. The ARNO model is characterized by two main components: the first and most important component represents the soil moisture balance, and the second describes the transfer of runoff to the outlet of the basin. The relevance of the soil component emerges from the highly nonlinear mechanism with which the soil moisture content and its distribution controls the dynamically varying size of the saturated areas mainly responsible for a direct conversion of rainfall into runoff. The second component describes the way in which runoff is routed and transferred along the hillslopes to the drainage channels and along the channel network to the outlet of the basin. Additional components, such as the evapotranspiration, snowmelt and groundwater modules, are also described. A discussion on the advantages of the model, calibration requirements and techniques is also presented, together with the physical interpretation of model parameters. Finally, after describing the original calibration of the ARNO model on the Arno basin, and a comparison with several conceptual models, recent applications of the ARNO model, as part of a real-time flood forecasting system, as a tool for investigating land use changes and as an interesting approach to the evaluation of land-surface-atmosphere interactions at general circulation model (GCM) scale, are illustrated.}
