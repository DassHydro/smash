========================
Cance - First Simulation
========================

This first tutorial with `smash` will be carried out on a French catchment, **the Cance at Sarras**, a right bank tributary 
of the Rhône river. This catchment was chosen for this first tutorial because its moderate size (380 km²)
enables fast computations at a spatial scale of 1km², and because it is well modeled with a low complexity
approach. This tutorial aims to

- provide an overview of the input data required for modelling with `smash`, 

- explain how to perform in Python a simulation and a simple model optimization from discharge data at a given gauging station.

Required data
-------------

Before you can start using `smash`, you need to download all the data required to run a simulation on this catchment.

.. button-link:: https://smash.recover.inrae.fr/dataset/Cance-dataset.tar
    :color: primary
    :shadow:
    :align: center

    **Download**

If the download was successful, a file named ``Cance-dataset.tar`` should be available. We can switch to the directory where this file has been 
downloaded and extract it using the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

    tar xf Cance-dataset.tar

Now a folder called ``Cance-dataset`` should be accessible and contain the following files and folders for various spatio-temporal data:

- ``France_flwdir.tif``
    A GeoTiff file containing the flow direction data,
- ``gauge_attributes.csv``
    A csv file containing the gauge attributes (gauge coordinates, drainage area and code),
- ``prcp``
    A directory containing precipitation data in GeoTiff format with the following directory structure: ``%Y/%m/%d`` 
    (``2014/09/15``),
- ``pet``
    A directory containing daily interannual potential evapotranspiration data in GeoTiff format,
- ``qobs``
    A directory containing the observed discharge data in csv format.

Flow direction
**************

The flow direction file is a mandatory input in order to create a mesh, its associated drainage plan :math:`\mathcal{D}_{\Omega}(x)`, and the localization on the mesh of the gauging stations that we want to model. Here, 
the ``France_flwdir.tif`` contains the flow direction data on the whole France, at a spatial resolution of 1km² using a Lambert-93 projection
(**EPSG: 2154**). `smash` is using the following D8 convention for the flow direction.
    
.. image:: ../../_static/flwdir_convention.png
    :align: center
    :width: 175

Gauge attributes
****************

To create a mesh containing information from the stations in addition to the flow direction file, gauge attributes are mandatory. The gauge 
attributes correspond to the spatial coordinates, the drainage area and the code of each gauge. The spatial coordinates must be in the same unit
and projection as the flow direction file (**meter** and **Lambert 93** respectively in our case), the drainage area in **square meter** (or **square kilometer** but it will need
to be converted later). The gauge code can be any code that can be used to identify the station. The ``gauge_attributes.csv`` file has been
filled in to provide this information for the 3 gauging stations of the Cance catchment.

.. note::

    We don't use the csv file directly in `smash`, we only use the data it contains. So it's possible to store this data in another format as long 
    as it can be read with Python.

Precipitation
*************

Precipitation data is mandatory. `smash` expects a precipitation file per time step whose name contains a date in the following format
``%Y%m%d%H%M``. The file must be in GeoTiff format at a resolution and projection identical to the flow direction file. Any unit can be chosen 
as long as it can be converted into a millimetre using a simple conversion factor (the unit used in this dataset is tenth of a millimetre). 
Regarding the structure of the precipitation folder, there is no strict rule, by default `smash`  will fetch all the ``tif`` files in a folder 
provided by the user (i.e. ``prcp``). However, when simulating a large number of time steps, we recommend sorting the files as much as possible to
speed up access when reading those (ex. ``%Y/%m/%d``, ``2014/09/15``).

.. note::

    As you may have seen when opening any precipitation file, the data has already been cropped over the catchment area. This has been done 
    simply to reduce the size of the files. It is possible to work with files whose spatial extent is different from the catchment area.
    `smash` will automatically crop to the correct area when the file is read.

Potential evapotranspiration
****************************

Potential evapotranspiration data is mandatory. The way in which potential evapotranspiration data is processed is identical to the 
precipitation. One difference to note is that instead of working with one potential evapotranspiration file per time step, it is possible to
work with daily interannual data, which therefore requires a file per day whose name contains a date in the following format ``%m%d``. 
Here, we provided daily interannual potential evapotranspiration data.

Observed discharge
******************

Observed discharge is optional in case of simulation but mandatory in case of model calibration. `smash` expects a single-column csv file for each gauge
whose name contains the gauge code provided in the ``gauge_attributes.csv`` file. The header of the column is the first time step of the time series,
the data is the observed discharge in **cubic meter per second** and any negative value in the series will be interpreted as no-data.

.. note::

    It is not necessary to restrict the observed discharge series to the simulation period. It is possible to provide a time series covering a larger time window over which `smash`
    will only read the lines corresponding to dates after the starting date provided in the header.

Now that a brief tour of the necessary data has been done, we can open a Python interface in the **conda environment**. The current working directory 
will be assumed to be the directory where the ``Cance-dataset`` is located.

Activate the environment:

.. code-block:: shell

    conda activate smash

Open a Python interface:

.. code-block:: shell

    (smash) python3

.. ipython:: python
    :suppress:

    import os
    os.system("python3 generate_dataset.py -d Cance")

Imports
-------

We will first import everything we need in this tutorial: `smash` of course, the numerical computing library `numpy <https://numpy.org/>`__, the data analysis and manipulation tool library `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`__,  and the visualization library `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`__.

.. ipython:: python

    import smash
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

.. hint::

    The visualization library `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`__ is not installed by default but can be installed with pip as follows:
    
    .. code-block:: none

        pip install matplotlib

Model creation
--------------

The `smash.Model` object is the entity around which the whole `smash` package revolves. In order to initialize this object, two informations are necessary, 
the ``setup`` and the ``mesh``.

Model setup creation
********************

The ``setup`` is a Python dictionary (i.e. pairs of keys and values) which contains all information relating to the simulation period, 
the structure of the hydrological model and the reading of input data. For this first simulation let us create the following setup:

.. ipython:: python

    setup = {
        "start_time": "2014-09-15 00:00", 
        "end_time": "2014-11-14 00:00",
        "dt": 3_600,
        "hydrological_module": "gr4", 
        "routing_module": "lr",
        "read_qobs": True, 
        "qobs_directory": "./Cance-dataset/qobs", 
        "read_prcp": True, 
        "prcp_conversion_factor": 0.1, 
        "prcp_directory": "./Cance-dataset/prcp", 
        "read_pet": True, 
        "daily_interannual_pet": True, 
        "pet_directory": "./Cance-dataset/pet", 
    }

To get into more details, this ``setup`` is composed of:

- ``start_time``
    The beginning of the simulation,

- ``end_time``
    The end of the simulation,

- ``dt``
    The simulation time step in **second**,

.. note::
    The convention of `smash` is that ``start_time`` is the date used to initialize the model's states. All 
    the modeled state-flux variables (i.e. discharge, states, internal fluxes) will be computed over the
    period ``start_time + 1dt`` and ``end_time``

- ``hydrological_module``
    The hydrological module, to be chosen from [``gr4``, ``gr5``, ``grd``, ``loieau``, ``vic3l``],

    .. hint::

        See the :ref:`Hydrological Module <math_num_documentation.forward_structure.hydrological_module>` section

- ``routing_module``
    The routing module, to be chosen from [``lag0``, ``lr``, ``kw``],

    .. hint::

        See the :ref:`Routing Module <math_num_documentation.forward_structure.routing_module>` section

- ``read_qobs``
    Whether or not to read observed discharges files,

- ``qobs_directory``
    The path to the observed discharges files,

- ``read_prcp``
    Whether or not to read precipitation files,

- ``prcp_conversion_factor``
    The precipitation conversion factor (the precipitation value in data, for example in :math:`1/10 mm`, will be **multiplied** by the conversion factor to reach precipitation in :math:`mm` as needed by the hydrological modules),

- ``prcp_directory``
    The path to the precipitation files,

- ``read_pet``
    Whether or not to read potential evapotranspiration files,

- ``pet_conversion_factor``
    The potential evapotranspiration conversion factor (the potential evapotranspiration value from data will be **multiplied** by the conversion factor to get :math:`mm` as needed by the hydrological modules),

- ``daily_interannual_pet``
    Whether or not to read potential evapotranspiration files as daily interannual value desaggregated to the corresponding time step ``dt``,

- ``pet_directory``
    The path to the potential evapotranspiration files,

In summary the current ``setup`` you defined above corresponds to :

- a simulation time window between ``2014-09-15 00:00`` and ``2014-11-14 00:00`` at an hourly time step. 

- a hydrological model structure composed of the hydrological module ``gr4`` applied on each pixel of the mesh and coupled to the routing module ``lr`` (linear reservoir) for conveying discharge from pixels to pixel downstream. 

- input data of observed discharge, precipitation and potential evapotranspiration will be read from the directories defined in the ``setup``  and containing the previously downloaded case data. A few options have been added for some of the input data, the conversion factor for precipitation, given that our data is in tenths of a millimeter, and the information that we want to work with daily interannual potential evapotranspiration data.

.. hint::

    Detailed information on the model ``setup`` can be obtained from the API reference section of `smash.Model`.

Model mesh creation
*******************

Once the ``setup`` has been created, we can move on to the ``mesh`` creation. The ``mesh`` is also a Python dictionary but it is automatically generated
with the `smash.factory.generate_mesh` function. To run this function, we need to pass the path of the flow direction file ``France_flwdir.tif`` 
as well as the data stored in the csv file ``gauge_attrivutes.csv``.

.. ipython:: python

    gauge_attributes = pd.read_csv("./Cance-dataset/gauge_attributes.csv")

    mesh = smash.factory.generate_mesh(
        flwdir_path="./Cance-dataset/France_flwdir.tif",
        x=list(gauge_attributes["x"]),
        y=list(gauge_attributes["y"]),
        area=list(gauge_attributes["area"] * 1e6), # Convert km² to m²
        code=list(gauge_attributes["code"]),
    )

.. note::

    We could also have passed on the gauge attributes directly without a csv file.

    .. ipython:: python
        :verbatim:

        mesh = smash.factory.generate_mesh(
            flwdir_path="./Cance-dataset/France_flwdir.tif",
            x=[840_261, 826_553, 828_269],
            y=[6_457_807, 6_467_115, 6_469_198],
            area=[381.7 * 1e6, 107 * 1e6, 25.3 * 1e6], # Convert km² to m²
            code=["V3524010", "V3515010", "V3517010"],
        )


.. ipython:: python

    mesh.keys()

To get into more details, this ``mesh`` is composed of:

- ``xres``, ``yres``
    The spatial resolution (unit of the flow directions map, **meter**)

    .. ipython:: python

        mesh["xres"], mesh["yres"]

- ``xmin``, ``ymax``
    The coordinates of the upper left corner (unit of the flow directions map, **meter**)

    .. ipython:: python

        mesh["xmin"], mesh["ymax"]

- ``nrow``, ``ncol``
    The number of rows and columns

    .. ipython:: python

        mesh["nrow"], mesh["ncol"]

- ``dx``,  ``dy``
    The spatial step in **meter**. These variables are arrays of shape *(nrow, ncol)*. In this study, the mesh is a regular grid with a constant spatial step defining squared cells.

    .. ipython:: python
        
        mesh["dx"][0,0], mesh["dy"][0,0]

- ``flwdir``
    The flow direction that can be simply visualized that way

    .. ipython:: python

        plt.imshow(mesh["flwdir"]);
        plt.colorbar(label="Flow direction (D8)");
        @savefig user_guide.quickstart.cance_first_simulation.flwdir.png
        plt.title("Cance - Flow direction");
    
.. hint::

    If the plot is not displayed, try the ``plt.show()`` command.

- ``flwdst``
    The flow distance in **meter** from the most downstream outlet

    .. ipython:: python

        plt.imshow(mesh["flwdst"]);
        plt.colorbar(label="Flow distance (m)");
        @savefig user_guide.quickstart.cance_first_simulation.flwdst.png
        plt.title("Cance - Flow distance");

- ``flwacc``
    The flow accumulation in **square meter**

    .. ipython:: python

        plt.imshow(mesh["flwacc"]);
        plt.colorbar(label="Flow accumulation (m²)");
        @savefig user_guide.quickstart.cance_first_simulation.flwacc.png
        plt.title("Cance - Flow accumulation");

- ``npar``, ``ncpar``, ``cscpar``, ``cpar_to_rowcol``, ``flwpar``
    All the variables related to independent routing partitions. We won't go into too much detail about these variables,
    as they simply allow us, in parallel computation, to identify which are the independent cells in the drainage network.

    .. ipython:: python

        mesh["npar"], mesh["ncpar"], mesh["cscpar"], mesh["cpar_to_rowcol"]
        plt.imshow(mesh["flwpar"]);
        plt.colorbar(label="Flow partition (-)");
        @savefig user_guide.quickstart.cance_first_simulation.flwpar.png
        plt.title("Cance - Flow partition");

- ``nac``, ``active_cell``
    The number of active cells, ``nac`` and the mask of active cells, ``active_cell``. When meshing, we define a rectangular area of shape *(nrow, ncol)* in which only a certain 
    number of cells contribute to the discharge at the mesh gauges. This saves us computing time and memory. 

    .. ipython:: python

        mesh["nac"]
        plt.imshow(mesh["active_cell"]);
        plt.colorbar(label="Active cell (-)");
        @savefig user_guide.quickstart.cance_first_simulation.active_cell.png
        plt.title("Cance - Active cell");

- ``ng``, ``gauge_pos``, ``code``, ``area``, ``area_dln``
    All the variables related to the gauges. The number of gauges, ``ng``, the gauges position in terms of rows and columns, ``gauge_pos``, the gauges code, ``code``, 
    the "real" drainage area, ``area`` and the delineated drainage area, ``area_dln``.

    .. ipython:: python

        mesh["ng"], mesh["gauge_pos"], mesh["code"], mesh["area"], mesh["area_dln"]

An important step after generating the ``mesh`` is to check that the stations have been correctly placed on the flow direction map. To do this, we can try to visualize on which cell each station is located and whether the delineated drainage area is close to the "real" drainage area entered.

.. ipython:: python

    base = np.zeros(shape=(mesh["nrow"], mesh["ncol"]))
    base = np.where(mesh["active_cell"] == 0, np.nan, base)
    for pos in mesh["gauge_pos"]:
        base[pos[0], pos[1]] = 1
    plt.imshow(base, cmap="Set1_r");
    @savefig user_guide.quickstart.cance_first_simulation.gauge_position.png
    plt.title("Cance - Gauge position");

.. ipython:: python

    (mesh["area"] - mesh["area_dln"]) / mesh["area"] * 100 # Relative error in %

For this ``mesh``, we have a negative relative error on the simulated drainage area that varies from -0.3% for the most downstream gauge to -10% for the most upstream one
(which can be explained by the fact that small upstream catchments are more sensitive to the relatively coarse ``mesh`` resolution).

.. TODO FC link to automatic meshing

Save setup and mesh
*******************

Before constructing the `smash.Model` object, we can save (serialize) the ``setup`` and the ``mesh`` to avoid having to do it every time you want to run a simulation on the same case,
with the two following functions, `smash.io.save_setup` and `smash.io.save_mesh`. It will save the ``setup`` in `YAML <https://yaml.org/>`__ format and the ``mesh`` in `HDF5 <https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5>`__ format.

.. ipython:: python

    smash.io.save_setup(setup, "setup.yaml")
    smash.io.save_mesh(mesh, "mesh.hdf5")

.. note::

    The ``setup`` and ``mesh`` can be read back with the `smash.io.read_setup` and `smash.io.read_mesh` functions

    .. ipython:: python

        setup = smash.io.read_setup("setup.yaml")
        mesh = smash.io.read_mesh("mesh.hdf5")

Finally, initialize the `smash.Model` object

.. ipython:: python

    model = smash.Model(setup, mesh)
    model

Model attributes
----------------

The `smash.Model` object is a complex structure with several attributes and associated methods. Not all of these will be detailed in this tutorial. 
As you can see by displaying the `smash.Model` object above after initializing it, several attributes are accessible:

Setup
*****

`Model.setup <smash.Model.setup>` contains all the information previously passed through the ``setup`` dictionary plus a set of other
variables filled in by default or potentially not used afterwards.

.. ipython:: python

    model.setup.start_time, model.setup.end_time, model.setup.dt

Mesh
****

`Model.mesh <smash.Model.mesh>` contains all the information previously passed through the ``mesh`` dictionary.

.. ipython:: python

    model.mesh.nrow, model.mesh.ncol, model.mesh.nac
    plt.imshow(model.mesh.flwdir);
    plt.colorbar(label="Flow direction (D8)");
    @savefig user_guide.quickstart.cance_first_simulation.model_flwdir.png
    plt.title("Cance - Flow direction");

.. note::

    Once the `smash.Model` object is initialized, the `numpy.ndarray` of the ``mesh`` are not masked anymore in the 
    `Model.mesh <smash.Model.mesh>`. It is therefore normal to have a difference in the non-active cells.

Atmospheric data
****************

`Model.atmos_data <smash.Model.atmos_data>` contains all the atmospheric data, here precipitation (``prcp``) and potential evapotranspiration
(``pet``) that are stored as `numpy.ndarray` of shape *(nrow, ncol, ntime_step)* (one 2D array per time step). We can visualize the value of 
precipitation for an arbitrary time step.

.. ipython:: python

    plt.imshow(model.atmos_data.prcp[..., 1200]);
    plt.colorbar(label="Precipitation ($mm/h$)");
    @savefig user_guide.quickstart.cance_first_simulation.prcp.png
    plt.title("Precipitation");

Or masked on the active cells of the catchment

.. ipython:: python

    ma_prcp = np.where(
        model.mesh.active_cell == 0,
        np.nan,
        model.atmos_data.prcp[..., 1200]
    )
    plt.imshow(ma_prcp);
    plt.colorbar(label="Precipitation ($mm/h$)");
    @savefig user_guide.quickstart.cance_first_simulation.ma_prcp.png
    plt.title("Masked precipitation");

The spatial average of precipitation (``mean_prcp``) and potential evapotranspiration (``mean_pet``) over each gauge are also computed
and stored in `Model.atmos_data <smash.Model.atmos_data>`. They are `numpy.ndarray` of shape *(ng, ntime_step)*, one temporal series by gauge.

.. ipython:: python

    code = model.mesh.code[0]
    plt.plot(model.atmos_data.mean_prcp[0, :], label="Mean precipitation");
    plt.plot(model.atmos_data.mean_pet[0, :], label="Mean potential evapotranspiration");
    plt.grid(ls="--", alpha=.7);
    plt.legend();
    plt.xlabel("Time step");
    @savefig user_guide.quickstart.cance_first_simulation.mean_prcp_pet.png
    plt.title(
        f"Mean precipitation and potential evapotranspiration at gauge {code}"
    );

Response data
*************

`Model.response_data <smash.Model.response_data>` contains all the model response data. Currently, the only model response data is
the observed discharge (``q``). The observed discharge is a `numpy.ndarray` of shape *(ng, ntime_step)*, one temporal series by gauge.

.. ipython:: python

    code = model.mesh.code[0]
    plt.plot(model.response_data.q[0, :]);
    plt.grid(ls="--", alpha=.7);
    plt.xlabel("Time step");
    plt.ylabel("Discharge ($m^3/s$)")
    @savefig user_guide.quickstart.cance_first_simulation.qobs.png
    plt.title(
        f"Observed discharge at gauge {code}"
    );

Rainfall-runoff parameters
**************************

`Model.rr_parameters <smash.Model.rr_parameters>` contains all the rainfall-runoff parameters. The rainfall-runoff parameters available 
depend on the chosen model structure and of the different modules that compose it. Here, we have selected the hydrological module ``gr4`` 
and the routing module ``lr``. This attribute consists of one variable storing the ``keys`` i.e. the names of the rainfall-runoff parameters 
and another storing their ``values``, a `numpy.ndarray` of shape *(nrow, ncol, nrrp)*, where ``nrrp`` is the number of rainfall-runoff 
parameters available.

.. ipython:: python

    model.setup.nrrp, model.rr_parameters.keys

To access the values of a specific rainfall-runoff parameter, it is possible to use the `Model.get_rr_parameters <smash.Model.get_rr_parameters>` 
method, here applied to get the spatial values of the production reservoir capacity

.. ipython:: python

    model.get_rr_parameters("cp")[:10, :10] # Avoid printing all the cells

The rainfall-runoff parameters are filled in with default spatially uniform values but can be modified using the 
`Model.set_rr_parameters <smash.Model.set_rr_parameters>`

.. ipython:: python

    model.set_rr_parameters("cp", 134)
    model.get_rr_parameters("cp")[:10, :10]
    model.set_rr_parameters("cp", 200) # Set the default value back

Rainfall-runoff initial states
******************************

`Model.rr_initial_states <smash.Model.rr_initial_states>` contains all the rainfall-runoff initial states. This attribute is very similar 
to the rainfall-runoff parameters, both in its construction and in the variables it contains.

.. ipython:: python

    model.setup.nrrs, model.rr_initial_states.keys

Methods similar to those used for rainfall-runoff parameters are available for states

.. ipython:: python

    model.get_rr_initial_states("hp")[:10, :10]
    model.set_rr_initial_states("hp", 0.23)
    model.get_rr_initial_states("hp")[:10, :10]
    model.set_rr_initial_states("hp", 0.01) # Set the default value back

Rainfall-runoff final states
****************************

`Model.rr_final_states <smash.Model.rr_final_states>` contains all the rainfall-runoff final states, i.e. at the end of the simulation time window defined in ``setup``. This attribute is identical to the rainfall-runoff initial states but for final ones. The final states are updated once a simulation is performed.

.. ipython:: python

    model.setup.nrrs, model.rr_final_states.keys

Rainfall-runoff final states only have getters and are by default filled in with -99 until a simulation has been performed.

.. ipython:: python

    model.get_rr_final_states("hp")[:10, :10]

Response
********

`Model.response <smash.Model.response>` contains all the model response. Similar to the model response data, the only model response is the
discharge (``q``). The discharge is a `numpy.ndarray` of shape *(ng, ntime_step)*, one temporal series by gauge.

.. ipython:: python

    model.response.q

Similar to rainfall-runoff final states, the response discharge is updated each time a simulation is performed. At initialization, response 
discharge is filled in with -99.

Model simulation
----------------

Different methods associated with the `smash.Model` object are available to perform a simulation such as a forward run or an optimization.

Forward run
***********

The most basic simulation possible is the forward run that consist in runing a forward hydrological model given input data. A forward run can be called with the `Model.forward_run <smash.Model.forward_run>` method.

.. To speed up documentation generation
.. ipython:: python
    :suppress:

    ncpu = min(5, max(1, os.cpu_count() - 1))
    model.forward_run(common_options={"ncpu": ncpu})

.. ipython:: python
    :verbatim:

    model.forward_run()

Once the forward run has been completed, we can visualize the simulated discharge for example at the most downstream gauge.

.. ipython:: python

    code = model.mesh.code[0]
    plt.plot(model.response_data.q[0, :], label="Observed discharge");
    plt.plot(model.response.q[0, :], label="Simulated discharge");
    plt.xlabel("Time step");
    plt.ylabel("Discharge ($m^3/s$)");
    plt.grid(ls="--", alpha=.7);
    plt.legend();
    @savefig user_guide.quickstart.cance_first_simulation.forward_run_q.png
    plt.title(f"Observed and simulated discharge at gauge {code}");

As the hydrograph shows, the simulated discharge is quite different from the observed discharge at this gauge. Obviously, we ran a forward run with the default `smash` rainfall-runoff 
parameter set. We can now try to run an optimization to minimize the misfit between the simulated and observed discharge. 

Optimization

Similar to the `Model.forward_run <smash.Model.forward_run>` method, an optimization can be called with the `Model.optimize <smash.Model.optimize>` method.

.. To speed up documentation generation
.. ipython:: python
    :suppress:

    ncpu = min(5, max(1, os.cpu_count() - 1))
    model.optimize(common_options={"ncpu": ncpu})

.. ipython:: python
    :verbatim:

    model.optimize()

And visualize again the simulated discharge compared to the observed discharge, but this time with optimized model parameters.

.. ipython:: python

    code = model.mesh.code[0]
    plt.plot(model.response_data.q[0, :], label="Observed discharge");
    plt.plot(model.response.q[0, :], label="Simulated discharge");
    plt.xlabel("Time step");
    plt.ylabel("Discharge ($m^3/s$)");
    plt.grid(ls="--", alpha=.7);
    plt.legend();
    @savefig user_guide.quickstart.cance_first_simulation.optimize_q.png
    plt.title(f"Observed and simulated discharge at gauge {code}");

Of course, the hydrological model optimization problem is a complex one and there are many strategies that can be employed depending on the modeling goals and data available. Here, for a first tutorial, we have run a simple optimization with the function's
default parameters (``SBS`` global :ref:`optimization algorithm <math_num_documentation.optimization_algorithm>`). The end of this section will be dedicated to a brief explanation of the information associated with the optimization performed.

First, several information were displayed on the screen during optimization

.. code-block:: text

    At iterate      0    nfg =     1    J =      0.695010    ddx = 0.64
    At iterate      1    nfg =    30    J =      0.098411    ddx = 0.64
    At iterate      2    nfg =    59    J =      0.045409    ddx = 0.32
    At iterate      3    nfg =    88    J =      0.038182    ddx = 0.16
    At iterate      4    nfg =   117    J =      0.037362    ddx = 0.08
    At iterate      5    nfg =   150    J =      0.037087    ddx = 0.02
    At iterate      6    nfg =   183    J =      0.036800    ddx = 0.02
    At iterate      7    nfg =   216    J =      0.036763    ddx = 0.01
    CONVERGENCE: DDX < 0.01

These lines show the different iterations of the optimization with information on the number of iterations, the number of cumulative evaluations ``nfg`` 
(number of foward runs performed within each iteration of the optimization algorithm), the value of the cost function to minimize ``J`` and the value of the adaptive descent step ``ddx`` of this heuristic search algorihtm. 
So, to summarize, the optimization algorithm has converged after 7 iterations by reaching the descent step tolerance criterion of 0.01. This optimization required to perform 216 forward run evaluations and leads to a final cost function value on the order of 0.04.

Then, we can ask which cost function ``J`` has been minimized and which parameters have been optimized. So, by default, the cost function to be minimized is one minus the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency ``nse`` (:math:`1 - \text{NSE}`)
and the optimized parameters are the set of rainfall-runoff parameters (``cp``, ``ct``, ``kexc`` and ``llr``). In the current configuration spatially
uniform parameters were optimized, i.e. a spatially uniform map for each parameter. We can visualize the optimized rainfall-runoff parameters.

.. ipython:: python

    ind = tuple(model.mesh.gauge_pos[0, :])
    opt_parameters = {
        k: model.get_rr_parameters(k)[ind] for k in ["cp", "ct", "kexc", "llr"]
    } # A dictionary comprehension
    opt_parameters

Save Model
----------

Before finishing this first tutorial, like the ``setup`` and ``mesh`` dictionaries, the `smash.Model` object, including the optimized parameters, can be saved to `HDF5 <https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5>`__ format
and read back using the `smash.io.save_model` and `smash.io.read_model` functions, respectively.

.. ipython:: python

    smash.io.save_model(model, "model.hdf5")
    model = smash.io.read_model("model.hdf5")
    model

This concludes this first tutorial on `smash`. The next quickstart tutorial will cover all of mainland France.

.. ipython:: python
    :suppress:

    plt.close('all')
